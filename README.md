# Weather Application on Google App Engine
Weather application hosted on Google App Engine.

This application is developed using python and flask. It is used to get current weather updates of different cities. 
All information related to weather is fetched from an API provided by OpenWeather. We have to pass the city name and API key as parameters to an API call. 
To get an API key, we first have to make an account on openweathermap.org and generate the API key. The same key should be used in all our API calls.
